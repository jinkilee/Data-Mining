It is little bit complicated to think of the number of dimension, however REALLY effective!!

Slightly starts to get used to theano package... however still so far away to go
Will definitely start to write some code from tomorrow

Don't try to copy others code!! Try to write your own!! Referring others code is OK but don't directly copy it!!
Start my CNN from the beginning again!! I will write my own network!!

Started my own programming task :) by the way kNN classification does not really need "training"??

Just simple approach may be working well.. don't try to build "nice model" all the times.

To show my work, it may be good to present with graph or plot.
Presentation is also really important skills!! FEEL IT!!
It shouldn't be good if no one can understand what I did!!
