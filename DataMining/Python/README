Python Broadcast is so effective to use :)
It is little bit complicated to think of the number of dimension, however REALLY effective!!

Slightly starts to get used to theano package... however still so far away to go
Will definitely start to write some code from tomorrow

Don't try to copy others code!! Try to write your own!! Referring others code is OK but don't directly copy it!!
Start my CNN from the beginning again!! I will write my own network!!

Started my own programming task :) by the way kNN classification does not really need "training"??
I guess so... because what you need to do is just to compare distance between training set and test set

Just simple approach may be working well.. don't try to build "nice model" all the times.

To show my work, it may be good to present with graph or plot.
Presentation is also really important skills!! FEEL IT!!
It shouldn't be good if no one can understand what I did!!

Don't DISLIKE exiesting library. Pandas really helped at this time!!

Someday, I need to write open-source library for security datamining, I guess
To do this, I need to practice high-performance python programming

Studied basic of Tensorflow :) quite interesting :)
Hmmmm by the way still confused with how to use
Basic step is...
1. create ops that do not need any input ex)constant
2. create ops that takes Tensor objects defined at step1
3. to actually run what I want, create session and launch with run()
4. result of step3 will be represented by numpy array or list or ...

Write a simple function to create pdf file of decision tree model
The pdf file includes a decision tree of a model

Generator was used to write kfold-crossvalidation

Just simply wrote my own code to calculate gini_coefficient. Just really really easy code!!
I should think of my own way of measuring distribution of data!!
